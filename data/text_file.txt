Success is counted sweetest
By those who neâ€™er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the Purple Host
Who took the Flag today
Can tell the definition
So clear of Victory

As he defeated, dying
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and clear.
Hello World I am a new line We are here in together
